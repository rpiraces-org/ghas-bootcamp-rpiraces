**Full Changelog**: [v4.1.0...v4.2.0](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/compare/v4.1.0...v4.2.0)

## [4.1.0] - 2023-07-07

This new version introduces a very common feature in the 2FA app world, the automatic generation and display of passwords.

Since the very beginning, 2FAuth offers an _Open, Click & Get one password_ behavior, this is one of the main reasons why I created it. But this can be very troublesome or frustrating for users migrating from other 2FA apps as almost all of them work with an _Open & Get passwords_ behavior, which is much more straightforward.

So this is now only a user choice as 2FAuth offers both behaviors via a user preference. Obvisouly, the _Open, Click & Get one password_ behavior remains the default one.

### Added

- A user preference to generate and show 2FA passwords on the main view without user interaction ([#153](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/153))
- An administrator setting to disable user registration ([#170](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/170))
- A `2fauth:install` Artisan command to ease both initial and upgrade installation.
- A spinner, during 2FA password loading - By [@josh-gaby](https://github.com/josh-gaby).
- Russian translation, but partial. Want to help complete this translation? ‚û°Ô∏è [2FAuth project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/2fauth).

### Changed

- Aegis migrations with empty `name` properties are no longer rejected. The `issuer` property is then used as a fallback value.
- The Docker image now embed the MySQL/MariaDB PHP extension, so it may be ready to work with.

### Fixed

- [issue #180](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/180) OTP does not rotate while _Close after copy_ and _Copy on display_ is activated - By [@josh-gaby](https://github.com/josh-gaby)

## [4.0.0] - 2023-04-14

Time for multi-user has arrived, here comes v4.0!

This is a first step mainly dedicated to internal changes, so the feature has been integrated gently. For now, almost nothing has changed around user management, except that registrations are opened to new users and some options are only available to the administrator.

This version also comes with nice additions. A light theme, an export feature or the support of custom base url just to name a few.

‚ö†Ô∏è This release drops PHP 8.0 support ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Added

- An Export feature (accessible via the _Manage_ view) that lets you download your 2FA data in a JSON migration file
- The Import feature accepts the 2FAuth JSON file generated by the Export feature
- Support of custom base URL. You can now install 2FAuth in a domain sub-directory, e.g `https://mydomain/2fauth/` (see [Docs](https://docs.2fauth.app/getting-started/installation/self-hosted-server//#subdirectory))
- ctrl+F keyboard shortcut to focus on Search on the main view
- A light theme
- IP addresses of failed login attempts are now logged

### Changed

‚ö†Ô∏è 2FAuth uses a new component to operate the WebAuthn authentication that cannot use existing registrations of your security devices. As a consequence, all your security devices will be revoked and the "Use Webauthn only" option will be disabled during the upgrade to avoid any issue and/or lockout. You will have to sign in using your email and password to re-register you security devices.

- The _Manage_ view layout has been rearranged: The search bar remains and the action buttons now stand in the page footer
- Password formatting is now a user option available with 3 formats: Grouping digits by pair, by trio or by half
- Failed login throttling and API calls throttling can be configured in the .env file
- Logs give more information
- Upgrade to Laravel 9.0

## [3.4.0] - 2022-10-20

This release is a big step towards more accessibility. Keyboard navigation is now fully supported, with clean and consistent focus, and several UI components have received relevant ARIA properties to support assistive technologies.

It also provides a rewritten Import feature that supports new export formats (Aegis and 2FAS Authenticators) and more to come.

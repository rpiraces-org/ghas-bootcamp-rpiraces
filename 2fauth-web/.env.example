#
# WARNING
# When using 'reverse-proxy-guard' 2FAuth only look for the dedicated headers and skip all other built-in

#
# Most authenticators and smartphones will ask the user to actively verify

# The intent is to distinguish one user from any other.
#
# Supported:
#   'required': Will ALWAYS ask for user verification
#   'preferred' (default) : Will ask for user verification IF POSSIBLE
#   'discouraged' : Will NOT ask for user verification (for example, to minimize disruption to the user interaction flow)
